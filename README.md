# Unexpected Behavior with Null Arguments in foo Function

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving unexpected behavior when null values are passed as arguments to a function.

The `foo` function in `bug.js` silently returns when null values are encountered. This can lead to unexpected program behavior and potential errors if not properly handled.

The solution in `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to explicitly handle null values using appropriate checks and error handling mechanisms.
